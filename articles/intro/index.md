# Why Python?

Before starting the main event, I'd like to write a sort of preface, that answers the basic questions which will surround this series. Why did I choose Python? Why are we making Hangman? And what's the plan after this series?

## The Goal
As will be restated in the next article, the goal of thise series is to get members to write their first game, completely on their own pace, and without any prior programming experience. So, now the question is, why am I choosing this approach, and what even is that approach?

## Why Python?
If you're a little bit familiar with programming, you may roughly understand that there are several different programming languages we, as programmers, can choose from. Without going into too much detail, what makes each programming language unique is the circumstances in which they're made for. C++, the language taught to students at CyFair for CS Majors, is primarily used for developing native projects, that is, projects which are run directly by the operating system. It also gives programmers the ability to manage memory directly, instead of being handled by the language itself.

C++ is not the only language that allows for these two features, so that's not all which makes it unique. There's also the standard library, the build tools, the syntax and semantics, and so on and so forth. If you don't understand what all that means, do not worry, this course is not about C++!

Instead, it'll be going over Python. The reasoning for this, is that Python is more beginner friendly. This does not make a toy, however. Python is extensively used in real world projects in all sorts of various fields, especially data science, and to an extent, game development. It's even what's used to make [this site](https://github.com/lonestarcyfair/lonestarcyfair.github.io/blob/main/build.py) stylish!

Python is also much easier to run compared to C++. Recall, that C++ produces programs which are run by the operating system. That means that programs produced by C++ are OS-dependent. If your friend has a mac, and you've made your program on Windows, you will not be able to share your program with them, unless they build the project on their system. Python, on the other hand, installs what's called an interpreter, and that is the program that *runs* your code. Thus, all your python programs depend on the interpreter rather than operating system, and as long as your neighbor has the interpreter installed, regardless of what OS they're running, they should be able to run your program without any hassle.

Keep in mind that all languages have their pros and cons. Python is more fit as an introductory language, and is faster to develop on compared to C++, which is why we'll be using it. C++ offers other benefits, such as performance, and the fact that it is OS-dependent, means there is no requirement to install an interpreter to run C++ programs.

## Why Hangman?
Game development takes a tremendous amount of time, and as games scale, so does development time. I, however, don't want you to keep waiting, and I'd rather make it possible to make your first game within a week.

The game itself, Hangman, is not sophisticted to program. It, in fact, would likely take an experienced programmer less than an hour to program. That is why it's the perfect project.

It is our goal that you understand every part of the game, and as such, I'll be introducing each concept in the next series of articles, and you'll see every single one applied to make the game. I hope that with this project knocked out, you'll feel ready to make your next game completely on your own, whether it be Hangman: The Electric Boogaloo, a text adventure, or even an RPG game.

## What's Coming Afterwards?
Developing your own game! But ok, you want to make the next big leap, how do you do that?

The plan is that after this series is written, I'll work on another series introducing PyGame, a python module which allows you to make your own "actual" game, i.e. one that has a window which you can interact with using a mouse.

However, since I am the sole author of all these articles, and considering the amount of time each one takes to write, it's questionable when I'll be able to finish the next series. It's possible that I could knock it out this summer, but it might have to wait until Spring break as I'm starting a new internship. Regardless, I hope this series alone will be enough to put you on the map so to speak, so that even in the event where the next series won't come out, you'll be able to continue to grow your knowledge through other means.

## How Do I Grow My Knowledge Through Other Means?
There's a rule of thumb that every programmer should go by. To my knowledge, all mainstream programming language have the goal of being easy to learn. As in, the authors of each language will write as much as they can to encourage new programmers to learn their language. They do this through the means of documentation, and Python is no exception. Right here, [https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/), contains everything you need to know about Python, and not only that, but it contains 100x more.

You want to learn PyGame too? Fear not, just like how authors of languages want to make it easy for you to learn said languages, authors of libraries have a similar goal! [https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), within this site, you'll find all the documentation and tutorials that you'll need.

Still want more? [Google](https://www.google.com), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and so many other sites and forums can suppliment your learning experience. All you have to be is willing to read and willing to try. I wish you luck on your journey, and with that, I hope you enjoy the next few articles!
