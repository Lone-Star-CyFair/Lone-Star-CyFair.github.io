<h1 id="the-new-constitution-annotated">The New Constitution, Annotated</h1>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-a-new-constitution">Why Do We Need a New Constitution?</h2>
<p>Simply put, we've not been following the constitution. Many of our procedures were improvised, officer positions have dramatically changed, club purpose has changed, and none of that is indicated in the constitution. This is important, since the constitution is one of the few documents which will be used next year, and unless we're fine restarting the club once again, we should take the time to reflect what we've learned in the constitution. Not only that, but I also want to provide the reasoning behind the decisions made, hence why I'm writing this article. The hope is that the club can thrive the next year and onwards, as they have all previous experience at the tips of their fingers.</p>
<p>The first draft of the new constitution can be found <a class=" underline" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LqDMpnyGIKsfbMQQjXhU8rbI7RXSnRC/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. I'll be skipping the boring sections and articles, such as Article 1. With that in mind, let's begin.</p>
<h2 id="article-ii-purpose">Article II PURPOSE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>• Meet others interested in CS</p>
<p>• Teach fundamental concepts in CS</p>
<p>• Learn interesting applications which go beyond academia</p>
<p>• Answer questions and assist students with classes or projects</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this is self-explanatory. The first bullet point is the point of all clubs. The second was chosen so that members have an easier time learning more advanced CS concepts. The third bullet point is to provide experience which you wouldn't receive in typical CS classes, such as using Unity or PyGame to develop games, or learn the PPM format to quickly output graphics, or learn interesting parsing algorithms, such as the L-1 parser, typically only taught in advanced classes. As you see, the third point is a very important one, as it introduces many new possibilities. The fourth point is to ensure academic success among our members.</p>
<h2 id="article-iv-officers-and-advisors">Article IV OFFICERS AND ADVISORS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 4: Duties of Officers</p>
<p><strong>President</strong>: Officer coordination and provides general direction for the club.</p>
<p><strong>Vice President</strong>: Unless the President is no longer in charge, the Vice President will be like the Operations
Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Operations Manager 1-3</strong>: Operations Managers execute the President’s vision, whether it is by managing streams, writing articles or meeting notes, and so forth. Their specific duties are to be set by the President.</p>
<p>Section 5: Should a vacancy in any office occur, it shall be filled either filled by a special election, or by the appointment of remaining officers, according to the President’s requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few sections are as important in the consitution as sections 4 and 5. As mentioned earlier, we've already been practicing this format, however, placing it in the consitution has become a very important step for us. Effectively, this setup eliminates roles. The older version contained officer titles such as "Secretary," "Treasurer," "Public Relations," which have all been condensced down to several Operations Manager. I found this to be a necessary step, since we rarely needed a secretary, rarely needed a PR officer, and especially in 2021, rarely needed a treasurer. If I were to actually follow the constitution, we would mostly house officers which did <em>nothing</em> for the majority of the semester.</p>
<p>The truth is, is that within our club, a single officer is more than adequate to manage many of these roles, as these duties do not take away much time. Not only that, but it's also common for officers to do work for other officers, rather than waiting for their queue. For instance, there's been several occasions where I, the President, acted as the Secretary, simply because I didn't want to wait and peer review notes about a lesson which I presented, and thus am capable of producing these notes. The Secretary has also sometimes acted as the PR whenever they post to the social media. And the social media person acted as the oeprations manager whenever they hosted a game night.</p>
<p>The boundaries between each duty are non-existent. The better solution would instead be to divide the tasks according to the club's current needs, rather than what the club will eventually need. Since I cannot predict what future presidents might need, or what I might eventually need, the only suitable officer title I could come up with was "Operations Manager." They would not be the OP in the old fashioned sense. Instead, their responsibilities would be agreed upon between them and the President, and regardless if it has to do with social media or teaching algorithms, the officers would fulfill their duty as per the agreement.</p>
<p>Such a system was especially useful for this year. Every two weeks, an article would release, as well as a live lesson. On other weeks, we would host game nights. Since each task is time consuming, we divided our tasks accordingly, so that one officer prepares for the live stream, another writes the article, and the third organizes the game night. Furthermore, if one officer wanted to switch tasks or take a break, then it would be totally feasible to do so, as duties are not hardly defined by the constitution.</p>
<h2 id="article-v-elections">Article V ELECTIONS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1: Time of Elections: It would take place on the day of the last official meeting of March, as well as the day after, resulting in an election which spans over two days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally, elections took place on the last week of class. That's finals week folks, not a very good time to start an election.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 2: Election Procedures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From at least two weeks prior the election, the President should be asking for interested volunteers to run for future officer roles, whose names should be on a public list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the start of the election, each running member would compete with other members running for the same officer position, except for Operations Manager 2 and 3, as they will be left vacant initially, and thus members will not be able to run for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Votes shall be anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the election, the running members with the majority votes would claim their officer positions for the next fiscal operating year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I will only focus on bullet point 2, since that's the most important. As discussed in the last section, our officers will simply range from President, VP, and three Operation Managers. Bullet point 2 states that only three officers will be elected by members of the club at first.</p>
<p>The benefit of this, is that the President is capable of choosing the number of officers running the club. Too often, clubs will either have a shortage of officers, or too many officers, and this especially has to do with how the President chooses to run his club. If it's run in such a way that all time consuming tasks can be evenly assigned by only three officers, than having two more officers will cause there to be idling. If the President is capable of choosing the number of officers present, then it's likely that they can reduce the idling there is.</p>
<p>Another point, is that once the officers figure out what they want to do, they can begin electing members based on their skill as it relates to the club's vision, rather than randomly select officers at the start and stick with them until the end. Officers can also expand their team once they realize which members are active and are willing to improve the club.</p>
<h2 id="article-vi-meetings">Article VI MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Article VI MEETINGS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1: Meeting time/date/location:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Survey the officers’ available meeting times for their general weekly schedule (suggestion: when2meet.com).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Survey the members’ available meeting times for their general weekly schedule, eliminating times where crucial officers are not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strip the available meeting times to only consist of the times where most members are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct one final poll with the members, which only consists of the times when most members are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most voted/preferred time would be the selected meeting time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a tie, the President will serve as the tie breaker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to specific about how I chose the meetings time. While we don't have a massive club, it's enough members to cause a headache if not done properly. So to save time, I've created a very simple procedure which is fully data driven and doesn't rely on random guesses or intuition. I hope it helps!</p>
<h2 id="article-viii-cheese">Article VIII CHEESE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No officer shall identify a member to be cheese, nor shall they describe their appearance to be cheese-like, with the exception that the member is an officer, or if the member would like to be called cheese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've had several attrocities occur at once with cheese-calling. This is to prevent such attacks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Those are all the important articles annotated. I hope you're able to get something out of it, and perhaps even if you're not a part of the CS club, it can benefit your club just as much as it benefited ours. The draft is still currently being revised, and so this annotation is subject to change. Regardless, hope you have a fantastic journey at Lone Star CyFair!</p>
